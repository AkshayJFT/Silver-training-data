to freedom of speech and expression;
[Editorial comment -The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, made several changes to the Fundamental Rights Part of the Indian constitution where it amended Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution to counteract the "abuse of freedom of speech and expression." This decision followed criticism in the press regarding the government's response to issues like the West Bengal refugee crisis and extrajudicial killings in Madras. Initial attempts to censor the press were ruled unconstitutional, leading the government to employ judicial decisions as justification for limiting freedom of speech. Despite opposition concerns about democratic principles, the Congress government proceeded with the amendment, citing international examples of regulating speech to prevent abuse. Important Verdicts: Brij Bhushan v State of Delhi, March 1950, and Romesh Thappar v State of Madras, May 1950. Also refer]
