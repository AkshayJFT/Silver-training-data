Application seeking condonation of delay in filing Review Petition is allowed.
The concurrent view taken by the Sessions Court and the High Court in convicting and sentencing the petitioner for having committed offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code was under challenge before this Court. Having considered the matter, this Court found no reasons to interfere and the Special Leave Petition was dismissed.
The grounds taken in Review Petition do not make out any error apparent on record to justify interference.
This Review Petition is, therefore, dismissed.
