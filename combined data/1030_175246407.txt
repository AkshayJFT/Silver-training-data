         INDU MALHOTRA, J.
Leave granted.
1. This   Special   Leave   Petition   has   been   filed   by   the   Insurance Company   to   challenge   the   compensation   awarded   on   certain counts by the Punjab & Haryana High Court in FAO No. 6943 of 2015 dated 27.09.2017, to be contrary to the Constitution Bench judgment in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi.1
2. The   factual   matrix   of   the   present   case,   briefly   stated,   are   as under:
1 (2017) 16 SCC 680 On   01.12.2013,   the   deceased   was   riding   his   motorcycle (Registration   No.   HR­71B­7681)   from   Ambli   Village   to   Arjun Majra Village. A relative of the deceased –Mr. Rakesh Kumar was following   him   on   a   separate   motorcycle   on   the   Sadhaura­ Naraingarh Road. A Renault car bearing Registration No. HR­02­ AB­4646 driven by Respondent No.3, came from the side, and hit the   motorcycle   driven   by   the   deceased.   The   accident   was witnessed by Mr. Rakesh Kumar.
As a result of the accident, the deceased fell and sustained multiple   injuries.   He   was   taken   to   the   Government   Hospital, Naraingarh from where he was referred to PGI, Chandigarh. On 02.12.2013   the   victim   was   taken   to   Government   Hospital, Panchkula where the doctors declared him dead.
On the same day, F.I.R. No. 337 was registered at Police Station, Naraingarh on the statement of Mr. Rakesh Kumar who was an eye­witness to the accident.
3. The   father,   brother,   and   sister   of   the   deceased   filed   Claim Petition   under   Section   166   of   the   Motor   Vehicles   Act,   1988 before   the   Motor   Accidents   Claim   Tribunal,   Yamuna   Nagar (“hereinafter referred to as MACT”) praying for compensation of Rs. 50,00,000 along with Interest from the date of the accident till the date of realization.
Mr. Rakesh Kumar, the eye­witness was examined before the MACT. He deposed stated that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent No. 3. 
The MACT after considering the evidence placed on record, came to the finding that the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent No. 3. 
The   deceased   was   24   years  old,   and  was  engaged  in   the business   of   manufacturing   Namkeen   products.   The   Claimants contended that the income of the deceased was Rs. 15,000 per month.   However,   they  were   unable   to   produce   evidence   of   the income   of   the   deceased.   The   MACT   took   the   income   of   the deceased   to   be   that   of   an   unskilled   worker   i.e.   Rs.   5,342   per month on the basis of the Notification dated 13.08.2013 issued by   the   Labour   Commissioner,   Haryana   prescribing   minimum wages for different categories of work.
The   MACT   awarded   compensation   to   the   family   of   the deceased as follows:
Head                                      Compensation awarded
i. Income:                                Rs. 5,432 per month
ii. Deduction towards 
                                          Rs. 1780 (1/3rd of income)
     personal expenses:
iii. Multiplier:                          7   (as   per   the   age   of   the
                            father)
iv. Loss of future income : Rs. 2,99,208  [i.e. (5432 – 1780) x 12x7] v. Loss   of   love   and Rs. 25,000 affection:
vi. Funeral Expenses:                     Rs. 15,000

Total Compensation                        Rs. 3,39,208 with interest @
awarded:                                  7%   from   the   date   of   the
                                          claim   until   realization   and
                                          costs.
The   MACT   did   not   award   any   compensation   to   the brother of the deceased, as he could not be considered to be a dependent. Compensation was awarded to the aged father and the unmarried sister of the deceased, who were held to be dependents.  
The Insurance Company and the driver of the vehicle – Respondent No. 3 both were held to be jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 
4. The Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 – i.e. the father and sister of the deceased filed an Appeal against the order of the MACT before   the   Punjab   and   Haryana   High   Court   praying   for enhancement of compensation.
The   High   Court   held   that   the   facts   relating   to   the accident were admitted and proved before the MACT. It was established   that  the   deceased  had died as  a result  of  the rash and negligent driving of Respondent No. 3. 
The   High   Court   found   that   the   MACT   had   used   the wrong   principle   for   application   of   the   multiplier.   The multiplier ought to have been taken on the basis of the age of the deceased, and not of his father.
The   High   Court   re­assessed   the   compensation   as follows:
Head Compensation awarded i. Income (as per minimum Rs. 6,000 per month wages):
ii. Future prospects at 50% Rs. 3,000 per month of (i):
iii. Total Income: Rs. 9,000 iv. Deduction   of   personal Rs.   3,000   (i.e.   1/3rd  of   total expenses: income) v. Multiplier: 18 (as per age of deceased) vi. Loss of future income: Rs. 12,96,000  [i.e.   (9,000   –   3,000)   x   12   x 18] vii. Loss   of   love   and Rs. 1,00,000 (i.e. Rs. 50,000 affection: each) viii. Funeral expenses: Rs. 25,000 Total Compensation  Rs.   14,21,000   with   interest awarded: @ 9% from the date of filing the   claim   petition   till realization.
The   amount   was   held   to   be   payable   jointly   and severally   by   the   Appellant   –   Insurance   Company   and Respondent No. 3.
5. Aggrieved   by   the   Order   of   the   High   Court,   the   Insurance Company filed the present S.L.P. before this Court, praying for setting­aside the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
6. We have heard learned Counsel for the parties, and perused the record.
The principal grounds on which the S.L.P. has been filed by the Insurance Company are:
i. The High Court has erroneously awarded 50% towards Future Prospects, even though as per the judgment of this   Court   in  National   Insurance   Co.   Ltd.  v.  Pranay Sethi.2 only 40% could have been awarded.  ii. The deduction of the income of the deceased ought to have been made at ½, and not at 1/3rd, as he was a bachelor.
iii. The   minimum   wages   of   the   deceased   ought   to   have been taken at Rs. 5,341 and not Rs. 6,000 as that was the   prevailing   rate of minimum wages in Haryana at the time of the accident.
iv. The   father   and   sister   of   the   deceased   could   not   be considered   as   dependants,   and   were   not   entitled   to compensation. In the case of death of a bachelor, only the mother could be considered to be a dependant.  v. The   grant  of   Rs. 1,00,000 on  account  of  loss  of  love and   affection,   and   Rs.   25,000   towards   funeral expenses is erroneous. 
It was contended that only Rs. 30,000 could have been   awarded   as   per   the   judgment   in  Pranay   Sethi (supra).
7. The dependents of the deceased refuted the grounds raised by   the   Insurance   company,   and   reiterated   their   claim   for enhanced compensation.
8. The   grounds   of   challenge   by   the   Insurance   Company   are dealt with seriatim.
8.1. With   respect   to   the   issue   of   Future   Prospects,   a Constitution   Bench   of   this   Court   in  Pranay   Sethi (supra)  has   held  that   in  case the   deceased was  self­ 2 (2017) 16 SCC 680 employed or on a fixed salary, and was below 40 years of age, an addition of 40% of the established income should be granted towards Future Prospects. 
Future Prospects are to be awarded on the basis of:
i. the nature of the deceased’s employment; and ii. the age of the deceased.
In the present case, it is claimed by the family of the deceased that he was engaged in making namkeen, and   was   earning   a   monthly   income   of   about   Rs. 15,000 per month. However, no evidence was brought on record to establish the same. The MACT as well as the High Court assessed the income of the deceased on the basis of the minimum wage of an unskilled worker. The nature of his employment being taken as a  self­ employed person.
The deceased was 24 years old at the time of the accident. Hence, future Prospects ought to have been awarded at 40% of the actual income of the deceased, instead of 50% as awarded by the High Court.
Hence,   the   judgment   of   the   High   Court   on   this issue is modified to that extent.
8.2. With respect to the issue of deduction from the income of   the   deceased,   the   Insurance   Company   contended that   the   deduction   ought   to   have   been   ½,   and   not 1/3rd, since the deceased was a bachelor. 
This issue has been dealt with in paragraph 32 of the   judgment   in  Sarla   Verma  (supra)   wherein   this Court   took   the   view   that   where   the   family   of   the bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, as in a case where he has a widowed mother and   large   number   of   younger   non­earning   sisters   or brothers,   his   personal   and   living   expenses   may   be restricted   to   one­third,   as   contribution   to   the   family will be taken as two­third.
Considering   that   the   deceased   was   living   in   a village, where he was residing with his aged father who was   about  65  years old, and  Respondent  No. 2 ­ an unmarried sister, the High Court correctly considered them  to  be  dependents of the deceased, and made a deduction   of   1/3rd  towards   personal   expenses   of   the deceased.
The   judgment   of   the   High   Court   is,   therefore, affirmed on this count.
8.3. With   respect   to   the   income   of   the   deceased,   as   the family could not produce any evidence to show that the income of the deceased was Rs. 15,000 per month, as claimed,   the   High   Court   took   his   income   to   be   Rs. 6,000, which is marginally above the minimum wage of an unskilled worker at Rs. 5,342.
This finding is also not being interfered with.
8.4. The Insurance Company has submitted that the father and the sister of the deceased could not be treated as dependents,   and   it   is   only   a   mother   who   can   be dependent of her son. This contention deserves to be repelled. The deceased was a bachelor, whose mother had   pre­deceased   him.   The   deceased’s   father   was about   65   years   old,   and   an   unmarried   sister.   The deceased was contributing a part of his meagre income to the family for their sustenance and survival. Hence, they   would   be   entitled   to   compensation   as   his dependents.
8.5. The Insurance Company has contended that the High Court had wrongly awarded Rs. 1,00,000 towards loss of love and affection, and Rs. 25,000 towards funeral expenses. 
The   judgment   of   this   Court   in  Pranay   Sethi (supra) has set out the various amounts to be awarded as compensation under the conventional heads in case of   death.   The   relevant   extract   of   the   judgment   is reproduced herein below :
“Therefore, we think it seemly to fix reasonable sums. It seems to us that reasonable   figures   on   conventional heads, namely, loss of estate, loss of consortium   and   funeral   expenses should be Rs. 15,000/­, Rs. 40,000/­ and   Rs.   15,000/­   respectively.  The principle of revisiting the said heads is   an   acceptable   principle.   But   the revisit   should   not   be   fact­centric   or quantum­centric.   We   think   that   it would   be   condign   that   the   amount that   we   have   quantified   should   be enhanced   on   percentage   basis   in every   three   years   and   the enhancement should be at the rate of 10% in a span of three years.”   (Emphasis supplied) As per the afore­said judgment, the compensation of Rs. 25,000 towards funeral expenses is decreased to Rs.15,000. 
The amount awarded by the High Court towards loss of love and affection is, however, maintained.
8.6 The MACT as well as the High Court have not awarded any compensation with respect to Loss of Consortium and Loss of Estate, which are the other conventional heads   under   which   compensation   is   awarded   in   the event   of   death,   as   recognized   by   the   Constitution Bench in Pranay Sethi (supra).
The Motor Vehicles Act is a beneficial and welfare legislation.   The   Court   is   duty­bound   and   entitled   to award “just compensation”, irrespective of whether any plea in that behalf was raised by the Claimant.
In exercise of our power under Article 142, and in the   interests   of   justice,   we   deem   it   appropriate   to award an amount of Rs. 15,000 towards Loss of Estate to Respondent Nos. 1 and 2.
8.7 A   Constitution   Bench   of   this   Court   in  Pranay   Sethi (supra)   dealt   with   the   various   heads   under   which compensation is to be awarded in a death case. One of these heads is Loss of Consortium. 
In legal parlance, “consortium” is a compendious term   which   encompasses   ‘spousal   consortium’, ‘parental consortium’, and ‘filial consortium’.
The   right   to   consortium   would   include   the company,   care,   help,   comfort,   guidance,   solace   and affection of the deceased, which is a loss to his family. With   respect   to   a   spouse,   it   would   include   sexual relations with the deceased spouse.3  Spousal consortium is generally defined as rights pertaining to the relationship of a husband­wife which allows compensation to the surviving spouse for loss of “company,   society, co­operation, affection,  and  aid of the other in every conjugal relation.”4 Parental consortium is granted to the child upon the premature death of a parent, for loss of “parental aid, protection, affection, society, discipline, guidance and training.” Filial   consortium   is   the   right   of   the   parents   to compensation in the case of an accidental death of a child.   An   accident   leading   to   the   death   of   a   child causes   great   shock   and   agony   to   the   parents   and 3 Rajesh and Ors. vs. Rajbir Singh and Ors. (2013) 9 SCC 54 4 BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (5th ed. 1979) family of the deceased. The greatest agony for a parent is to lose their child during their lifetime. Children are valued   for   their   love,   affection,   companionship   and their role in the family unit.
Consortium is a special prism reflecting changing norms   about   the   status   and   worth   of   actual relationships.   Modern   jurisdictions   world­over   have recognized   that  the   value  of   a   child’s   consortium  far exceeds   the   economic   value   of   the   compensation awarded   in   the   case   of   the   death   of   a   child.   Most jurisdictions   therefore   permit   parents   to   be   awarded compensation under loss of consortium on the death of a   child.   The   amount   awarded   to   the   parents   is   a compensation for loss of the love, affection, care and companionship of the deceased child. 
The Motor Vehicles Act is a beneficial legislation aimed   at   providing   relief   to   the   victims   or   their families, in cases of genuine claims. In case where a parent has lost their minor child, or unmarried son or daughter, the parents are entitled to be awarded loss of consortium under the head of Filial Consortium. 
Parental Consortium is awarded to children who lose their parents in motor vehicle accidents under the Act.
A   few   High   Courts   have   awarded   compensation on   this   count5.   However,   there   was   no   clarity   with 5 Rajasthan High Court in Jagmala Ram @ Jagmal Singh & Ors. v. Sohi Ram & Ors  2017 (4) RLW 3368 (Raj);
Uttarakhand High Court in Smt. Rita Rana & Anr. v. Pradeep Kumar & 6 Ors. 
respect to the principles on which compensation could be awarded on loss of Filial Consortium. 
The   amount   of   compensation   to   be   awarded   as consortium   will   be   governed   by   the   principles   of awarding compensation under ‘Loss of Consortium’ as laid down in Pranay Sethi (supra).
In   the   present   case,   we   deem   it   appropriate   to award   the   father   and   the   sister   of   the   deceased,   an amount   of   Rs.   40,000   each   for   loss   of   Filial Consortium.
9. In light of the above mentioned discussion, Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are entitled to the following amounts :­ Head Compensation awarded i. Income: Rs. 6,000 ii. Future Prospects: Rs.   2,400   (i.e.   40%   of   the income) iii. Deduction towards  Rs.   2,800   [i.e.   1/3rd  of personal expenditure: (Rs.6,000 + Rs.2,400)  iv. Total Income: Rs.   5,600   [i.e.   2/3rd  of (Rs.6,000 + Rs.2,400] vi. Loss of future income: Rs. 12,09,600 (Rs.5,600 x 12 x
