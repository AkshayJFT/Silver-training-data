ASHOK BHUSHAN, J.
By this writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioner has prayed for directions declaring the notification dated 27.03.2020 issued by Reserve Bank of India as ultra vires to the extent it charges interest on the loan amount during the moratorium period.
2. The petitioner’s case and the pleadings in the writ petition briefly noted are:-
2.1 The petitioner has availed a home loan of amount of Rs.37,48,000/- from the ICICI Bank.
After declaration of Coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic by World Health Organisation, the National Disaster Management Authority exercising the jurisdiction under Section 6 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 to take effective measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 across the country and for mitigation of the threatening disastrous situation has issued notification dated 27.03.2020 directing the Ministry, Departments of Government of India, State Governments and the State authorities to take measures for ensuring social distancing so as to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country. Necessary guidelines were also issued under Section 10(2)(1) by the National Executive Committee.
2.2 The Reserve Bank of India on 27.03.2020 issued Statement of Development and Regulatory Policies where inter alia certain regulatory measures were announced to mitigate the burden of debt servicing brought about by disruptions on account of COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure the continuity of viable businesses. The notification dated 27.03.2020 was issued by the Reserve Bank of India for rescheduling of payments – Term Loans and Working Capital Facilities. Relevant part of the notification relevant for the present case is as follows:-
“(i) Rescheduling of Payments – Term Loans and Working Capital Facilities
2. In respect of all term loans (including agricultural term loans, retail and crop loans), all commercial banks (including regional rural banks, small finance banks and local area banks), co-operative banks, all-
India Financial Institutions, and NBFCs (including housing finance companies) (“lending institutions”) are permitted to grant a moratorium of three months on payment of all instalments1 falling due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020.
The repayment schedule for such loans as also the residual tenor, will be shifted across the board by three months after the moratorium period. Interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period.” 2.3 The petitioner’s case in the writ petition is that when all the means of livelihood have been curtailed by the Government of India by imposition of complete lockdown pan India, due to worldwide spread of COVID-19 pandemic, the petitioner has no way to continue to his work and earn livelihood. The petitioner’s case is that imposition of interest during the moratorium period is ultra vires and shall defeat the purpose of permitting the moratorium of loans.
2.4 Referring to notification dated 27.03.2020, petitioner pleads that Reserve Bank of India has by the notification made it clear that interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period. Petitioner’s case is that the above action of imposition of interest during the moratorium period is completely devastating and causes hindrance and obstruction in right to life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. Petitioner’s case is that the additional interest burden for three months’ moratorium period is also equally divided in all future EMIs, which is to increase the monthly bill of the customer.
2.5 The petitioner’s case is that the notification qua payment of interest violates the principle of natural justice as the Government on one hand ceased the working of the individuals and on other hand asking to pay the loan interest during moratorium. The petitioner’s case is that although the initial lockdown was for a period of three weeks but it was extended further. The Reserve Bank of India by a subsequent notification dated 23.05.2020 due to the extension of the lockdown and due to disruption on account of COVID-19 has directed all commercial banks to extend the moratorium by another three months, i.e., from 01.06.2020 to 31.08.2020 on payment of all installments in respect of term loans. The notification dated 23.05.2020 directed for repayment schedule for term loans as also the residual tenor will be shifted across the board. Notification further stated that “interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period”.
2.6 The petitioner in the writ petition has prayed for following reliefs:-
a) Issue an appropriate Writ, Order or Direction in the nature of mandamus or any other appropriate writ or Direction declaring the portion of impugned Notification dated 27.03.2020 issued by Respondent No.2 as ultra vires to the extent it charges interest on the loan amount during the moratorium period, which create hardship to the Petitioner being borrower and creates hindrance and obstruction in “right to life” guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India;
and
b) Issue a Writ, Order or Direction in the nature of Mandamus thereby directing the Respondents to provide relief in repayment of loan by not charging interest during the moratorium period declared by Notification dated 27.03.2020; and/or
c) Pass any other order or orders which may be deemed fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case and in the interest of justice.” 2.7 Notices were issued in the writ petition. While hearing the matter on 17.06.2020 the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner have been noted to the following effect:-
“We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner(s).
Learned counsel for the petitioner(s) submits that under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the Central Government has ample power and jurisdiction to grant relief with regard to loan which is specifically provided for. It is submitted that the circular of the Reserve Bank of India dated 27.03.2020 although grant moratorium but substantially no relief is given to the borrowers.
The two-fold submissions have been made by learned counsel for the petitioner(s). It is submitted that if moratorium is being granted for a period of three months, the entire amount payable including principal and interest should not be charged during moratorium 3 period. Secondly, at least the demand of interest on interest should not be made and these reliefs can be extended by the Central Government and the Reserve Bank of India.” 2.8 In the writ petition, affidavits have been filed both by the Union of India as well as the Reserve Bank of India. In the affidavits filed on behalf of the Union of India, it was pleaded that the Central Government is fully conscious of the difficulties faced by the various sectors and the stakeholders of various sectors within the purview of the Ministry of Finance and other Ministries. It is further pleaded that Finance Ministry, after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic globally, has taken several measures of relief dealing with the potential problems faced by several sectors and in several spheres of all financial worlds. In the affidavit filed dated 31.08.2020, details of number of measures to mitigate financial suffering have been enumerated. It has been further pleaded that Finance Ministry took the initiative and interacted with Reserve Bank of India requesting the Reserve Bank of India to provide for various measures of relief to the borrowers. The affidavit also enumerates different reliefs and measures taken by Reserve Bank of India with regard to moratorium. Reference has been made to two circulars dated 06.08.2020 issued by Reserve Bank of India facilitating revival of real sector activities and mitigating the impact on the ultimate borrowers by enabling lenders to grant concessions to borrowers for COVID- 19-related stress in personal, MSME and corporate loans. The Union of India has filed further affidavits dated 09.10.2020, 23.10.2020 and 17.11.2020.
2.9 The Reserve Bank of India has also filed a counter affidavit, a consolidated counter affidavit dated 09.10.2020, additional affidavit dated 09.10.2020 and further additional affidavit dated 01.11.2020.

We, thus, proceed to decide the Writ Petition (C) No. 825 of 2020.
5. In course of hearing of these petitions, learned senior counsel for the petitioner, Shri Rajiv Duta has expressed satisfaction on the measures taken by the Government of India with respect to borrowers in which category the petitioner belongs. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that the decision of the Central Government to forego interest on eight specified categories of loans paid upto Rs.2 Crores has come as a great relief.
6. Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General submits that the Central Government is fully conscious of the difficulties faced by the various sectors and the stakeholders of various sectors and the Finance Ministry, after the outbreak of COVID-19, has taken several measures of reliefs dealing with the potential problems faced by several sectors and in several spheres of all financial worlds. Shri Mehta has referred to number of measures taken by the Central Government to mitigate the financial suffering as detailed in its affidavits as noted above. In its affidavit dated 23.10.2020, it is stated that the decision taken by the Central Government for granting various reliefs for the COVID-19 pandemic for benefit of waiver of interest upto Rs.2 Crores in eight categories has been approved by the Union Cabinet in its meeting dated 21.10.2020 and Ministry of Finance has issued directions dated 23.10.2020 on the subject, which has been brought on record alongwith the affidavit. Shri Mehta submits that in pursuance of circular dated 23.10.2020, as a follow-up towards the implementation of the aforesaid decision, the State Bank of India has informed that as on 13.11.2020, as per provisional, unaudited information received so far from various lending institutions, such lending institutions have released ex-gratia amount of an aggregate exceeding Rs.4,300 Crores in over 13.12 Crore accounts of borrowers covered under the Scheme.

8. We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the records.
9. The pandemic COVID-19 has not only caused serious threat to the health of the people but has also cast its shadow on the economic growth of the country as well as other countries in the entire world. Due to lockdown imposed by the Government of India in exercise of powers under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, there can be no denial that most of the businesses including private sector as well as public sector has been adversely affected. For several months, large number of industries were not allowed to function and exemptions were granted only to few of the industries to run and carry on its activities, which were found essential and necessary in the fact situation. Although, gradually, due to Unlock- 1, 2 and 3, the industries and other business activities have been restored and the economy of the country is on track although at a slow pace. The moratorium period as granted by the Reserve Bank of India vide orders dated 27.03.2020 and 23.05.2020 have continued from 01.03.2020 to 31.08.2020, i.e., for the period of six months. As submitted by the learned Solicitor General and reflected by the affidavits filed on behalf of the Union of India, it is clear that Central Government was fully conscious of the difficulties faced by the various sectors and the stakeholders of various sectors and different measures by Finance Ministry have been taken in the above reference, which has been detailed in the affidavits dated 31.08.2020, 09.10.2020 and 23.10.2020.
